## Introduction

- This activity will install the tools required to build Express applications and demonstrate how they run. Three examples will be showcased.
     - [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en): JavaScript-based runtime environment to develop web apps.
     - [Express](https://expressjs.com/): JavaScript-based framework used to run web servers.
     - [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/): IDE used develop, run and debug.
     - [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/): Adds static typing to JavaScript.
