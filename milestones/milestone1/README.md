# CST-391 Milestone 1 - Project Proposal

**Eastern Ridge Church App**

- Author: Danielle DeSilvio
- Date: September 13, 2025

## Introduction

The Eastern Ridge Church is a hypothetical church aiming to provide its members a means of accessing the topical content and resources found within their sermons. Users of the application will be able to see sermon summaries, verses referenced, and the songs used in the worship service.

Members will additionally be able to send messages to church faculty and make donations through the app.

## Risks

Time management is the most notable, if the only, concern that would be involved in this project. To a degree, this has been mitigated by the fact that it is a fairly small project that will not need much setup, especially in regards to data management.

It will, however, still require a great amount of time to realize, even during its prototyping stages - something that can be difficult to find and dedicate for a student with an unpredictable schedule such as myself. How this will be handled will be evaluated in the coming weeks.
